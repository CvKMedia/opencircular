# OpenCircular Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the OpenCircular project, including decision-making processes, maintainer responsibilities, and community participation guidelines.

## Project Vision

OpenCircular aims to be a production-ready, open-source platform that simplifies AI provider connectivity and monitoring. We strive to maintain high code quality, comprehensive documentation, and a welcoming community.

## Governance Model

OpenCircular follows a **lazy consensus** model with designated maintainers who have commit access and decision-making authority.

### Lazy Consensus

- **Proposals**: Anyone can propose changes via issues or pull requests
- **Discussion Period**: Allow reasonable time for community feedback (typically 72 hours for minor changes, 1 week for major changes)
- **Consensus**: If no objections are raised, the proposal is considered accepted
- **Objections**: Must be accompanied by constructive feedback and alternative suggestions

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

**Anyone** can be a contributor by:
- Reporting bugs or suggesting features
- Submitting pull requests
- Improving documentation
- Helping other users in discussions
- Reviewing pull requests

**No special permissions required** - all contributions are welcome!

### Maintainers

Maintainers have commit access and are responsible for:

- **Code Review**: Reviewing and merging pull requests
- **Release Management**: Creating releases and managing versioning
- **Issue Triage**: Labeling and prioritizing issues
- **Community Management**: Fostering a welcoming environment
- **Technical Direction**: Making architectural decisions

**Current Maintainers:**
- *To be established as the project grows*

**Becoming a Maintainer:**
- Demonstrate consistent, high-quality contributions
- Show good judgment in code reviews and discussions
- Be nominated by existing maintainers
- Consensus approval from current maintainer team

### Project Lead

The project lead has additional responsibilities:
- **Final Decision Authority**: In case of unresolved disputes
- **Maintainer Management**: Adding/removing maintainers
- **Strategic Direction**: Long-term project planning
- **External Relations**: Representing the project publicly

## Decision Making Process

### Minor Changes

**Examples**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, small feature additions

**Process**:
1. Submit pull request
2. Allow 72 hours for feedback
3. Address any concerns raised
4. Merge if no objections

### Major Changes

**Examples**: New AI providers, architectural changes, breaking API changes

**Process**:
1. Open an issue for discussion
2. Allow 1 week for community feedback
3. Create RFC (Request for Comments) if needed
4. Address feedback and iterate
5. Implement with pull request
6. Final review by maintainers

### Breaking Changes

**Examples**: API changes, configuration format changes, dependency updates

**Process**:
1. Must be discussed in advance
2. Require maintainer consensus
3. Must include migration guide
4. Follow semantic versioning
5. Announce in release notes

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, technical discussions
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions, ideas, community chat
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and implementation discussions

### Guidelines

- **Be Respectful**: Follow our code of conduct
- **Be Constructive**: Provide actionable feedback
- **Be Patient**: Allow time for responses
- **Be Clear**: Use clear, concise language

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Cycle

- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical bugs
- **Minor Releases**: Monthly or when significant features are ready
- **Major Releases**: When breaking changes are necessary

### Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**
   - Update version numbers
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Test all functionality

2. **Create Release**
   - Tag the release in Git
   - Create GitHub release with notes
   - Update documentation

3. **Announce Release**
   - GitHub release announcement
   - Update README if needed
   - Notify community

## Conflict Resolution

### Process

1. **Direct Discussion**: Try to resolve disagreements through respectful dialogue
2. **Maintainer Mediation**: Involve maintainers if direct discussion fails
3. **Community Input**: Seek broader community feedback if needed
4. **Project Lead Decision**: Final authority rests with project lead

### Principles

- **Assume Good Intent**: Believe others are acting in good faith
- **Focus on Technical Merit**: Base decisions on technical considerations
- **Consider User Impact**: Prioritize user experience and needs
- **Maintain Project Goals**: Align with project vision and values

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

### Violations

Code of conduct violations will be handled as follows:

1. **Warning**: First offense, private communication
2. **Temporary Ban**: Repeated violations, temporary restriction
3. **Permanent Ban**: Severe or continued violations

### Reporting

- **Confidential**: All reports handled confidentially
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
